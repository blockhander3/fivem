					This mainmenu div should be left as it is, you should change the buttons though.

					If you want to make a submenu, then you must create a new div, with the ID of the
					div being the data-sub attribute of the button that will open it. For example, the
					below button Example Submenu, has the data-sub attribute of "examplesubmenu", which
					is the same id as the div below. All submenus must also have a data-parent attribute.
